For this exercise we needed to resolve the TSP problem using two methodes:
- One fast with sufficiant results
- One precise but taking more time tto compute

For the first one I used the greedy algorithm,I tried toimplement a look ahead to ameliorate the algorithm but the results were not better.
For the second algorithm I used simulated annealing, using a greed search to obtain the best parameters.
